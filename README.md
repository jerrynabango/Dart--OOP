**Understanding Object-Oriented Programming**

**1. Classes and Objects:**
In OOP, a class is a blueprint for creating objects. Objects are instances of classes that represent real-world entities. In our car management system, classes such as `Car`, `Driver`, `Mechanic`, and `SparePartSeller` represent different entities involved in the system.

```dart
class Car {
  String model;
  String color;
  
  Car(this.model, this.color);
}

var myCar = Car('Toyota', 'Blue');
```

**2. Inheritance:**
Inheritance allows a class (subclass) to inherit properties and behaviors from another class (superclass). For example, `Mechanic` and `SparePartSeller` classes implement the `CarService` interface, inheriting methods like `repairCar()` and `provideSpareParts()`.

```dart
abstract class CarService {
  void repairCar();
  void provideSpareParts();
}

class Mechanic implements CarService {
  // Mechanic class inherits CarService interface methods
}

class SparePartSeller implements CarService {
  // SparePartSeller class inherits CarService interface methods
}
```

**3. Polymorphism:**
Polymorphism allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass. For instance, both `Mechanic` and `SparePartSeller` classes implement the `CarService` interface, enabling them to be used interchangeably where `CarService` objects are expected.

```dart
void serviceCar(CarService service) {
  service.repairCar(); // Polymorphism: can call repairCar() for Mechanic and SparePartSeller
}

var mechanic = Mechanic('John', 'Engine Specialist');
var sparePartSeller = SparePartSeller('Alice', 4.5);

serviceCar(mechanic); // Passing Mechanic object
serviceCar(sparePartSeller); // Passing SparePartSeller object
```

**4. Encapsulation:**
Encapsulation hides the internal implementation details of a class from the outside world. By using access modifiers like `public`, `private`, and `protected`, we can control the access to class members. For example, properties of the `Car` class (`model` and `color`) can be made private to restrict direct access.

```dart
class Car {
  String _model; // Private property
  String _color; // Private property
  
  Car(this._model, this._color);
}
```
